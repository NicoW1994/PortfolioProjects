In this project I create a Web Application that is based on the Shiny package in R.
It uses the covid dataset to display different features for a selection of countries.

In this case the data is pulled from a rds file, that was prepared by accessing a MySQL database.
For data preparation see: https://github.com/NicoW1994/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Data%20Exploration%20with%20SQL%20and%20Dplyr
